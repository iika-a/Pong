# iika's Pong
A semi-modern Pong game written in Kotlin.

## Description
This game is a side project that I also uploaded as Project #1 for my APCS Portfolio.
This is also my first time writing Kotlin programs as well as developing a game in general.

## Installation & Usage

## Features
I tried to include every feature that I could think of to keep the game replayable and make it not that boring.
- 3 Game Modes
- 3 (or infinitely many) Game Maps
- 5 Toggleable Power Ups
- 3 Special Modifiers
- Customizable Colors
- Customizable Keybinds
- Local Multiplayer

## Goals
Goals I want to implement in the future. (NOT CONFIRMED)
- More Power Ups
- More Maps
- Refactor code to be better (I'm just a beginner)
- Online multiplayer (I need to learn networking)
